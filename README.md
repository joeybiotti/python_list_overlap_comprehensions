# Python List Overlap Comprehensions 

Another really simple python console app. Two random lists of numbers and a third list that's made up of the numbers that appear in both lists. Because the app is using the _random module_, the numbers _should_ be different everytime (of course, there may be some overlap-- hence the name of the exercise).

Anyways. I found this exercise where I found almost all of these python exercises, <a href="http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/10/10-list-overlap-comprehensions.html">Here</a>.
